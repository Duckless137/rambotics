It's in Python (booooo)

I like C 

# Pull requests
Make a new branch please 
Never commit directly to main

How to use Git if you don't know:
```how_to.sh
echo "Cloning the repository"
git clone git@github.com:Duckless137/rambotics.git

echo "Creating new branch"
git switch -c "branch_name"

echo "Pushing to origin"
git push origin "branch_name"

echo "Update local codebase"
git pull origin main
```
Change "branch_name" to the name of the 
feature you want to add
